I really like Pluto

Why do you really like Pluto? It's not even a planet (but the recent images of it are really cool).


Screw NASA, they ruined my childhood with their decision.

A multi-billion probe project just to ruin someone's childhood. Damn them.

Anyway, there are nitrogen ice volcanoes on Pluto are amazing! Not many trees there though. Hardly going to become a hot holiday destination.

My friend went to Chile and looked at planets through a telescope, she said pluto was bigger than Jupiter. I do not beleive her

It's all lies.
